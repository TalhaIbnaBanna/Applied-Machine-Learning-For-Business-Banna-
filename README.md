# SVM CLassifier

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from UCI. The notebook covers the fundamentals of SVM, data preprocessing, model training (with and without scaling), performance evaluation, visualization techniques (PCA and AutoEncoders), comparisons, and kernel impacts.

**ipynb Overview**

The ipynb provides a step-by-step guide to implementing and understanding SVM classifiers. It uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify tumors as malignant or benign. Additional examples include the Iris dataset for multi-class classification and make_moons to illustrate kernel differences.
Key highlights:

* SVM theory and components (hyperplanes, support vectors, margins, kernels).
* Data handling: Loading, preprocessing, scaling.
* Model evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curves, cross-validation.
* Dimensionality reduction: PCA and AutoEncoders for visualization.
* Kernel comparisons: Linear vs. RBF.
* Baseline models for performance benchmarking.
